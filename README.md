# face-db-book
## Description
face-db-book is a social network API designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data efficiently using a NoSQL database. The API allows users to manage their usernames, thoughts, and reactions in a social network setting. I worked on this little project for a challenge assigned to me and to better understand working with MongoDB. It was truly fascinating to see the smoothness of the CRUD operations and I'm excited to do more with this new skill.

## Technologies Used
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- Mongoose

## Installation & Demo
Simply download the files provided by the application's [repo](https://github.com/Kushonim/face-db-book) and/or follow along with the [demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T4Bo9jfgu4IFRFJeu0MZVfNIqDmI56hQ/view). If there is no video available, open the assets folder's integrated terminal and install all npm's and run npm start.

## Usage
To interact with the API, use an API testing tool like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send HTTP requests to the endpoints for your user creation, thoughts, and reactions. With the added function of a friendlist, you can utilize all of the CRUD operations as needed and see how each request affects the data. Ultimately it's a fun API to mess around with and get in some practice for junior web devs like me.
